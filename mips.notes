arch/mips/kernel/irq.c - rollback
 Removed __IMEM prefix from do_IRQ.
 It is preformance optimisation. For the moment, to simplify,
 I will disable SPRAM: TC3162_IMEM, TC3162_DMEM config defs.
 __IMEM is optional, from include/linux/kernel.h:

     #ifdef CONFIG_TC3162_IMEM
     #define __IMEM  __attribute__  ((__section__(".imem_text")
))
     #else
     #define __IMEM
     #endif

 arch/mips/include/asm/thread_info.h - rollback, partially
  alloc_thread_info is not defined in linux5. Why:
  http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail//linux/kernel/1205.1/00234.html
  http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail//linux/kernel/1205.1/00227.html

  #define alloc_thread_info(tsk) kzalloc(THREAD_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL)
  kzalloc is kmalloc but will fill zeros. Why do this?
  alloc_thread_info is called from kernel/fork.c, diff:
  static inline struct thread_info *alloc_thread_info(struct task_struct *tsk)
  {
 -#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
 +#if defined(CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE) || defined(CONFIG_CPU_TC3162) || defined(CONFIG_MIPS_TC3262)
 	gfp_t mask = GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO;
 #else

 __GFP_ZERO means fill zeros.
 So may be for debugging.

 The driver calls register_pci_controller from pci-legacy, so
 CONFIG_PCI_DRIVERS_LEGACY should be set.

 Turn off TCSUPPORT_WLAN_MT7592_PCIE and TCSUPPORT_BONDING since I
 do not know if this will work with free WiFi driver.

 flash_init initializes flash_base variable and that is it. It is
 set to 0xbc000000 for my SoC. This variable was used in
 tc3162-flash.c for locating trx header which contains kernel
 offset and length for MTD partitions configuration.

 spi_nand_flash.c:spi_nand_read_internal
 if(  (0xbc000000 <= addr) ...
   ...
   addr &= 0x03ffffff

 This fun is called by nand_chip funcs.
 So it seems flash_base is unnecessary for this driver.

 The func will calculate page_number from addr and call
 spi_nand_read_page which will ask NAND flash chip to load
 page into its cache, sending page_number byte by byte to
 the chip:
   WriteReg(_SPI_CONTROLLER_REGS_MANUAL_DFIFO_WDATA, addr_byte)
            0xBFA10000 + 0x0038

 I've removed IRQF_DISABLE, it was removed from kernel:
 http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2015-March/058135.html
 If routine assumes IRQ disabled, then what? local_irq_enable_in_hardirq()
 is not longer called: https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/3/25/435

 __cpuinit seems to be deprecated:
 https://lwn.net/Articles/304687/
 There is no cpu_data[cpu].vpe_id field. Use cpu_vpe_id(&cpu_data[cpu])
 https://www.spinics.net/lists/mips/msg51559.html

 Replace setup_irq, which is not present anymore, with request_irq.
 TODO: What if cpu_has_vint is true, it will register twice?
  if (cpu_has_vint)
    set_vi_handler(BUS_TOUT_INT, bus_timeout_dispatch);
  request_irq(BUST_TOUT_INT, bus_timeout_interrupt, 0, "bus timeout", NULL);

  In linux2.6, cycle_t was u64, from include/linux/clocksource.h.

arch/mips/ralink/malta-smp.c - new-file, ignore
  Removed IRQF_DISABLE.
  There is no smp_call_function_interrupt(). In 2.6:
  void __irq_entry smp_call_function_interrupt(void)
  {
        irq_enter();
        generic_smp_call_function_single_interrupt();
        generic_smp_call_function_interrupt();
        irq_exit();
  }
  There is:
  void generic_smp_call_function_single_interrupt(void);
  #define generic_smp_call_function_interrupt \
        generic_smp_call_function_single_interrupt

  There is also CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_IPI and some similar code in
  arch/mips/kernel/smc.c. This ipi_call_interrupt will just call
  generic_smp_call_function_interrupt(). It will not call irq_enter() ..

  MIPS do_IRQ already does irq_enter() .. irq_exit().

  So I will use generic_smp_call_function_interrupt.

  OK. In the end:
  smp-mt.o: .. undefined reference to `mips_smp_send_ipi_single'
  smp-mt.o: .. undefined reference to `mips_smp_send_ipi_mask'

  IRQ_MIPS_CPU helps, this selects generic irq ipi.

  This did not work:
  Kernel bug detected[#1]:
  ...

  [<80027068>] ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1c

  GENERIC_IRQ_IPI requires irqdomain and of_node. IRQ_MIPS_CPU will
  also select GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP, which adds irqdomain and is similar
  to irq_chip defined in irq.c, but not exactly the same. For
  example, TC3262 interrupts:
  enum interrupt_source
        {
                DUMMY_INT,
                UART_INT,               //0     IPL10
                PTM_B0_INT,             //1
                SI_SWINT1_INT0, //2
                SI_SWINT1_INT1, //3
		TIMER0_INT,     //4     IPL1
		...
		SI_SWINT_INT0,  //7
                SI_SWINT_INT1,  //8


  irq-mips-cpu.c:
  >The first two are software interrupts
  While SI_SW* interrupts begin from 2 and from 7. There is irq
  mapping, hwirq -> irq, I do not know yet how this works.

  So I've disabled IRQ_MIPS_CPU altogether and implemented missing
  calls.

  TODO: There is IRQ_MIPS_CPU will also enable generic affinity and
  I did not upgrade affinity code, may be generic will be useful.
