1.
simple_map_init is defined in drivers/mtd/maps/map_funcs.c
    map->read = simple_map_read;
    map->write = simple_map_write;

simple_map_read(struct map_info *map, unsigned long ofs)
{
        return inline_map_read(map, ofs);
}

inline_map_read is in include/linux/mtd/map.h
 if (map_bankwidth_is_1(map))
                r.x[0] = __raw_readb(map->virt + ofs);

__raw_readb is here: include/asm-generic/io.h
static inline u8 __raw_readb(const volatile void __iomem *addr)
{
	return *(const volatile u8 __force *)addr;
}

Later spi_nand_flash will call nand_scan_ident and nand_scan_tail, these will set their own map->read, etc, fields.

So map->virt is not sued. ioremap is not necessary.

2. The structure of nand_chip changed, there is no write_buf, for example, but there is chip.legacy with these fields.

3. spi_nand_flash.c:spinand_cmdfunc will save to _current_cache_page. spinand_read_buff, depending on command and some other options, will just copy _current_cache_.
